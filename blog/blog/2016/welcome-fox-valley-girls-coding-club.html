<h1>Welcome, Fox Valley Girls Coding Club!</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="/blog/girls_that_code_whiteboard-25371858.jpg" /></p>

<p>This week completes our first month as Fox Valley's only makerspace. Aside from adding <em>4 new members in a 2 week period</em>, we were also lucky enough to host the <a href="http://foxvalleygirlscodingclub.com/">Fox Valley Girl's Coding Club</a>. The club empowers girls to learn IT skills and solve the industry's long standing diversity problem.</p>

<p>We're very excited to be a part of this exciting endeavor. Welcome to the community, girls!</p>

<h2 id="whats-next-for-foxbuild">What's Next for Fox.Build</h2>

<p>In the coming weeks we will be continuing facility improvements, such as adding more group work stations and hosting our usual <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BurbDev/events/228814236/">Monday free co-working day</a>. Come stop by any Monday and check out the facility.</p>

<p>For those who can't make it out during business hours, we also host a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Fox-Build-Coworking-Hacking-Maker-Space-in-St-Charles/events/228701757/">First Friday Tech Social</a> starting at 3:30pm on the first Friday of the month.</p>

<p>Fox.build is a great place to work, especially if you typically work from home and feel like you're missing the sense of community you might find at a traditional office. We're a friendly bunch and are always looking for new members.</p>
